<h3>Lab 1 Classification with Multinomial and Gaussian Models</h3>

The first part of this lab involved designing a **Naives Bayes classifier** to flag emails as "spam" or "ham (not-spam)" based on whether and how many times a certain list of words appeared in the email. Using a **multinomial distribution** for the feature vector and a **maximum likelihood estimate** with **Laplace smoothing** for the probabilities, expressions for the predictors,
